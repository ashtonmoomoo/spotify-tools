# Spotify Tools

A collection of tools I have found myself wanting to use on my Spotify library, all collated into one webapp - partially to keep them in one place and share components, and partially because I only have one set of the API keys I need :eyes:

## Roadmap

In no particular order...

#### Backup Features

- [x] Export liked songs to CSV
- [x] Import (liked) songs from CSV
- [x] Like songs from CSV that aren't in current library
- [ ] Export selected playlists to CSV
- [ ] Import to existing playlist, or new playlist

#### Duplicates

- [ ] Identify duplicates in liked songs
- [ ] Fix duplicates in liked songs
- [ ] Identify duplicates in liked albums
- [ ] Identify duplicates in playlists
- [ ] Fix duplicates in playlists

#### General

- [ ] Like songs from albums that are liked but don't have all songs liked
- [ ] Create Spotify playlists based on Last.fm listening history

##### Maybe this app, maybe a different one...

- [ ] Shuffle, but it's _all_ of Spotify :thinking:

### Development

WIP
